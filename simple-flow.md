- Assume there is an existing token on stacks (token 1 T1)
- I want to bridge that token to ethereum
- I have 100 T1
- Steps
  - The user deploys a token manager contract
    - the token calls the register the canonical token in the stacks ITS factory (register-canonical-interchain-token through the factory) permissionless
      - registers the token id which is a hashed version of the sender the salt and stores its metadata for stacks
      - ITS send a gateway message to verify the contract (payload : contract address, token id, token address)
        - msg arrives to the validators
        - validators check the message sender is the ITS contract
        - validators send proof to gateway
        - they check the token manager contract is valid
        - relay calls the ITS contract function to execute-enable-token (source-chain) (message-id) (source-address) (payload-hash)
          - calls validate message on the gateway to check the token manager contract is valid
    - deploy remote canonical interchain token for remote chain
      - pay gas
      - sends a gateway message with the token info
    - token is registered
  - interchain transfer on the ITS (same transaction)
    - lock the token on the token manager contract
    - pay gas
    - send the gateway message (_transmitInterchainTransfer)
